The project's aim is to deploy two machine learning models as APIs for a U.S. retailer with ten stores across California, Texas, and Wisconsin. The first model predicts sales revenue for specific items in individual stores on given dates, while the second forecasts total sales revenue for the next 7 days across all stores and items. The models address the need for precise revenue predictions, essential for inventory management and business planning.
The project's significance lies in data-driven insights that help optimize operations and revenue. Predictive and forecasting models guide decisions on inventory, store-specific sales strategies, and resource allocation.
1. Predictive Model: We've built a predictive model using machine learning to accurately forecast item-specific store sales on specific dates. It's been rigorously trained and evaluated, ensuring its reliability.
2. Forecasting Model: For total sales revenue predictions over the next 7 days, we've implemented a time-series forecasting model. This model supports proactive decision-making by providing insights into revenue trends.
3. API Deployment: Both models were deployed through Heroku-based APIs, offering the ability to retrieve predictions for specific items, stores, dates, and 7-day national revenue forecasts.
In conclusion, these models can equip the retailer with data-driven tools to enhance sales predictions, optimize resources, and make better inventory decisions. Thus contributing to improved business operations, leading to revenue maximization.
